<p>Proper ethical hacking and vulnerability disclosure practices have presented a timeless argument for hackers and information security professionals alike since the inception of the Internet.  Many young information security professionals, including myself, were not around for these early conversations on what constitutes ethical hacking.  I thought it would be pertinent to highlight some of these conversations to better understand in what ways computer security has changed as well as how it has remain the same.  To my knowledge the oldest underground bulletin board is the 8BBS system (circa 1979-80) which I have unfortunately been unsuccessful in locating an archive.  It would be interesting to see if/how the concept of ethical hacking was approached in the early 1979-80’s.</p>

<p>Below are a selection of emails and posts from the MindVox system which pertain to ethical hacking.  These emails and posts were written between 6 August 1992 and 9 June 1993.  The thoughts expressed in these emails remain remarkably relevant today.</p>

"Is it ethically ok to access computers that don't belong to you?"

That's a very un-answerable question since it will vary greatly from one 
individual to the next.  You'd have to define "ethical" first and then make
sure that everyone involved adhered to the same interpretation of the word,
and then give everyone a BIG COLORFUL BADGE that says "AUTHORIZED" and follow
it all up with a firm handshake looking deeply into their eyes and saying "I
love you" and . . . umm, where was I, oh yeah....

It is my personal belief that NO ONE has the RIGHT to access any computer,
network, device, or place; virtual or physical, that does not belong to them,
or where they have not been CLEARLY invited by the owner's or representatives
of same.

If EVIL SUPER-BAD MEGACORP has 24 Connection Machines accessible via local
dialup, and the root password is "abcdef" you still do not have the "right"
to access their machines, much less take any sort of action against them. 


But ya know, there's right and wrong, good and evil, anthracite and puce, and
then there's stupidity.  While you have the absolute right to take a new
Ferrari, leave the keys in the ignition, the window rolled down, and park it
in Harlem....   there's this wonderful thing called COMMON SENSE that
says,  "Gee ya know... that may not be a very good idea!"  Computer
security is very similar to that.  While I know a lot of people who, um...
look at things... and very few of them have any sort of harmful intentions,
much less interest in the data they gain access to...  I also trust their
judgement about as much as I  trust the average 6th grader's.  They don't
mean any harm, none-the-less it  certainly isn't helpful to me for anyone
else to have access to MY PERSONAL JUNK.

What I'm finding more and more, is people who have sensitive material on their
computer, just aren't hooking them into networks.  As an example there's my
father, and a lotta his friends.  They have contracts with the government and
various military agencies, they have a lotta stuff on their machines that
is  considered "classified" or sensitive.  Their solution to security, is
purely physical in most cases.  They don't know much about Unix, and they
don't wanna know, they don't read news, or want to get email from people,
they just don't bother to plug their personal machines into the ethernet. 
The only way to get at its contents is to physically steal the thing.

When you're running simulations or something that is extremely processor 
intensive, then obviously it has to go on other machines, or over
networks, but for the most part, what's really "sensitive" is just
information that isn't meant to be publicly accessible. 

What comprises "sensitive" material varies greatly, company X's SUPER NEW 
ULTRA-SECRET THREE WEEK PLAN, is probably of interest to nobody, except
COMPANY Y who is in competition with 'em. 

All things are relative; right now the attitude is that people find this lack
of "security" scary, so they run around in little circles, call up various law
enforcement agencies, who in turn grab their guns and kick in doors and
make a big fuss over it.

When people are scared, they tend to do silly things.  People ARE *VERY*
afraid right now, of a lot of things in general, and this is one area in
which fear can be very effectively channeled and focused on THE BAD GUY,
who in most cases is represented as some teenager who is personally
responsible for EVERYTHING wrong with their lives in general, and their
computer's in particular.

None of it bears any relation to reality, but then again, neither does life
most of the time.

I never cease to be surprised when people smugly state "you don't have to
hack into something, why, you can BUY your own unix box for 'x' hundred
dollars."  I had no idea that unix is all there ever was.  There really
isn't anything else out there?  Just unix???  Wow.  Wait, isn't this Earth
in the 20th century?  Whoops!  Silly me!  Back into the TARDIS!  
&lt;whoosh!&gt;

That's like saying "Columbus didn't have to discover the New World and
annoy the natives, he had plenty of land in Europe to play with!"

All these folks talking about hacking and yet..
not a hacker among you..
If i read another posst from you 
leeches , killer cracker using
card abuse, code dialing,
board calling , .edusite inet
account crackers post anpother
annoying thing i will laugh
again becase you are laughing
stock..
then.. there was the outsiders looking in who think
they know.. thisisnt a snide remark but sudeenly bruce sterling
wrote a book andnow thinks he is (wellnot thinks.. everyone else thinks
this too) he is an expert on "hacking" and the "underground"
no true practionerof this clandestine art has really come forward
if they do.. it usually is some old timer who is completely out of
touch with what is ot t out thier now..
Rhetoric!#@
tons of cool thingshave happened and can stillhappen..
but only by the few..
the few ..
never have so many been so terrorized by so few..
sure.. people say hacking is dead.. the balance disrupted de
due to the busts of the hackers responsible for
the "trickle-down theory" (which isbasically what the PUBLIC underground
works on fortythe casual hackers)
and technology advances which allowfor clear digital monitoring and call 
tracing..
but the truth is there will always be someone there
to answer the challangee.. 
 
but it certainly isnt ANY of you!#@

Nice message Tox, had a lot of interesting points to cover and its
applicable long past its time. 

Speaking of real hackers and ethics, John Lee (Corrupt) aka: netw1z online
here a few weeks ago, was sentenced to 1 year in jail on Monday I think,
or late last week. SLAM DUNK.

<p>This message from LOD Communications struck a chord with me since the activities and people involved in the 8BBS system were just as much ancient history to the MindVox group as the MindVox group is ancient history to myself.  An apt analogy to this would be a Roman soldier admiring the ancient Egyptian pyramids after overtaking the Ptolemaic Kingdom in 30 BCE and a tourist admiring the ancient pyramids today.</p>

Ali Baba: Regarding the Mondo/Vox article etc., the project actually got
started when some of us started dusting off our old disks for PAT/VOX. After
talking it over with PAT late last year (we have been working on this ever
since) it was determined that they were way too busy with the upgrades at Vox
to do anything with our disks and printouts. After we realized how much work
was involved we had to make a decision as to what direction this project was
to take, if any.

The people involved in this project (quite a few actually) are not in high
school with nothing better to do (not that we think anyone reading this
is) and therefore value what little spare time they have. Its one thing to
ask people to give up most of their free time, its another to say that they
won't be compensated for all the effort. So a "pittance" as Erikb says, is
being charged not so much for the information itself (information wants to
be free!#@$&amp;1), but for all the effort and costs (well over $1000 believe
it or not) to bring the information to the masses errrr all 30 people in
the U.S. [as Thug says ;) ].

As for the LOD Retirement Village 8+/, a lot of the money will be recycled
for 2 other projects whose aim is to provide additional historical background
on the Computer Underground Community. And although it may not seem like
much, at least half of the sales of the Metal Shop Private BBS Message Base
will be donated to Knight Lightning's (Craig N.) legal defense fund...after
all, they helped too. More of a non-profit organization than a "ruthless
corporate power"....

The project's aim in addition to 'making our old machines work again' as
ErikB says, is to document some of the history of the 'dark' portion of
Cyberspace. No one is exactly sure how many people really care, but from the
large response we have received due to ads in 2600, Phrack, and CUD, there
appears to be plenty out there who want to see what went on. An interesting
point is how many people on the planet even have messages from some of the
first (if not THE 1st) phreak/hack BBS systems such as 8BBS (Circa 1979/80)?
We have found only one source through all our contacts. And that source has
them on a TRS-80 machine that wasn't powered up in 6 years or so. He has been
dutifully transferring messages at 300 baud (Modems still go that slow?) in
his spare time (very little as he manages a TV station and has a family).

To recapitulate on the main goal--it is to continue to scrounge around for
all these old messages (which are really quite interesting since we have
basically excluded C0DEZ B0ARDZ) and provide a fairly comprehensive look at
the use of BBS's for Underground Activities. Unfortunately, without the
support of the public, it may not be possible to sustain the effort due to
the costs involved but we will see how things play out.

It's funny but a lot of people today forget that back then we did not have
14.4 Kbaud modems and 250 MB hard drives. Most messages we have were
downloaded at 300 baud onto 143K disk drives, with each file usually no
larger than 15K in size (And we LIKED it! Where's my funny looking Hat? ahem)
Its not like anyone called up all the bbs's one after the other, downloaded
the complete message base in 10 minutes, saved it into one file per bbs, and
is now selling them. Not that anyone here is implying that either.

Deckard: "quicktime interviews with the old hackers, etc." One thing we did
do is track down a lot of the system operators of the boards or those who
were on the board and knew inside details. We twisted their arms to write a 
"BBS Pro-Phile" [Ala Taran King's Phrack Pro-Phile] specifically for this
project. The BBS Pro-Phile provides various background information on the
different Boards and interesting stories related to them. In addition Philes
online were added to the message bases if we could find them. Ie: all the
Osuny "bulletins" are included in the Osuny message base (circa 1982/3 and
over 370 msgs thus far).

Regarding CD_ROMs: It was decided to just provide the Message Base Files in
compressed format on 3.5/5.25 diskettes. Since we aren't interested in
selling stuff that is readily accessible on the Internet (ie: electronic
newsletters, etc. via ftp.eff.org) the volume of material really doesn't
warrant a CD. Besides, we would be pricing the stuff out of the range of many
people which is something we didn't want to do. 
In addition, how many people have CD_ROM Drives? More every day but they
still aren't as prevalent as diskette drives.


Hope we aren't repeating ourselves too much, a lot of these details are
described in the LISTING due out in 1-2 weeks. Guess the Round-Table is Elite
since they get the scoop on this before the public does :)

"finger lodcom" for a bit more additional information on the project if you
like. And if anyone wants to help, let us know.
